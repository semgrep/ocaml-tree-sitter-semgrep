    * Unfortunately, `...>` is a valid custom operator in Swift, and it can
    * occur as part of an expression. So, for the pattern `<... 5 ...>`, it gets
    * lexed as `<...`, followed by the expression `5`, followed by a
    * `custom_operator` token. This doesn't fit the deep ellipsis rule, so it
    * results in a parse error.
    *
    * A proper fix would be to extend the scanner so that `...>` is its own
    * token, and then handle it separately in the grammar. This would be
    * complicated, and would likely present significant maintainability
    * challenges because the way custom scanners are structured does not invite
    * extensibility. We would probably have to maintain a fork of the scanner.
    *
    * Instead, we just replaced `...>` with `$.custom_operator` in this rule.
    * Unfortunately, it will prevent people from writing patterns like `<... 5
    * .+. 1 ...>` because the custom operator in the middle will get mistaken
    * for the end of the deep ellipsis. However, this can easily be worked
    * around with parentheses, and it's probably going to come up rarely, if
    * ever.
